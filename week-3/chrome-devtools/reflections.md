How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

It gives you a real-time sense of what your CSS will do.  The refresf to reset feature makes it really easy to test confidently.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

Changing the width and height attributes with px, em, or percentage metrics.

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Absolute: Positioned in relation to its direct parent element.
Fixed: Positioned in relation to the screen.
Static:  No unique positioning for the element.  Falls in line with the page flow.
Relative: Positioned relative to it's natural static positioning.

Fixed was really straightforward.  Absolute seemed to have a more complex relationship with styling attributes, so we tended not to toy with it.

What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

Margin: Difference between the content and and surrounding content and/or page borders.
Border: A physical outline of the content's shape and any padding that may be applie.
Padding: Space between content and the border.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

It was very useful, and good as a pairing challenge because working in a team diffused some of the frustration.
