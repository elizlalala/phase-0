What is a wireframe?

	A wireframe is an image of what your site or product will look like after development.

What are the benefits of wireframing?

	1. You first wireframe the design or a number of designs to get approval and feedback from your clients first off.  You wouldn't want to develop a site and then ask the client what they think of the design.

	2. Wireframes are also great "maps" for the semantic HTML and CSS styling that will follow.  You can see all of the visual elements that need to be coded in development.  Doing this from memory would be very difficult.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

	I did!  It made me a little excited to actually build the site and the blog.

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

	I revised mine after a few days actually.  It was slight, but I had a better idea of what I wanted after spending more time with other modules.

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

	The only real questions I had were around which program to use for wireframing.  I liked the suggested Balsamiq just fine in the end.  I think I wouldn've been as quick on more rudimentary presentation softwares like Keynote or Powerpoint.  Balsamiq also shows a beginner the different type of elements I may want to include in my visual.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

	This challenge wasn't too tedious.  I enjoyed toying with the basic design of both my site and blog.  I'm also really starting to get more comfortable with my Git commands.  That is enjoyable.
