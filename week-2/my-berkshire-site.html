- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

So far, it's been straight forward.  We looked up a couple items on Google.  We really should have used the markup validation service because we wasted some time figuring out that we didn't close an anchor tag.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

This question is a bit confusing actually.  Nothing that we used in this markup is specific to HTML5, and it didn't seem as though the assignment called for any elements specific to HTML5.  That said, the answer to the previous question probably holds for this question as well...

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

We had to practice a little restraint from formatiing in HTML.  We believe that we will not be removing any "stylistic" elements from our HTML code and moving it to a CSS file later.  It was a little disappointing to not be able to style the site exactly like the original.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

The Bad: It's difficult to read through the  cluttered-looking file.  That made it harder to spot our error when we forgot to close an anchor tag.  No good way to style on it's own.

The Good: It's functionally simple, and pretty easy to pick up quickly.  Not to mention, there are a ton of readily available resources to look up when you don't know something.  It's nice that there is only one language to markup a browser.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML? 

A great memory - or don't have one and exercise Google frequently.  Always remember to close your tags... except when you don't.  Always run it through a linter.
