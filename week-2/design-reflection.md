My favorite aspect of this challenge was learning the distinction between design and user experience.  The two objectives are deeply intertwined but ultimately different from one another.  I definitely always used these terms interchangeably until now.  

Additionally, I did feel like some of these reflection questions were frivolous and redundant, however I guess they forced me to articulate my planning of this site even though I felt as thought there wasn't a whole lot of structure that I was choosing on my own.  The question about "desired actions from the target audience" did have me second guessing my placement of Contact information and such.

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

	My website's primary goal is to display both my skills and interests.  Ideally any potential employers or collaborators would care heavily about the intersection of the two, and not just the skillset.  Prospective clients may care moreso about skillset and my design style.  Because there are ultimately two buckets of information that any visitor will quickly want to grasp, I think that my title page will include  bullet text or images that immediately touch on each.  From there, they can move to About Me to learn more about my passions, and to my projects to see my skills on display.  My resume and social links merely provide identity transparency and professional background.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

	My primary audience will be employers, clients, or other developpers who are interested in collaborating on projects.  Hence, my target audience is interested in employing me or working with me.  They care about me being a good fit for the work they need done and the team that I would be joining.  Without a face to face, my site should give them a quick taste of my personality and my ability to help them.


What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

	The primary action is for someone to decide if they want to work with me, and if so, contact me.  To encourage these actions, my title page will include contact information and snapshots of my interests and skills.


What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

	Design is the objective layout of your site.  User experience is how a user feels as they navigate your site.  Your design should support the desired experience that your target user has when they visit your site.  Although, you cannot control user experience for every possible visitor to your site.  Inevitably different individuals will perceive and experience your site in different ways.  The best you can do is to design toward the desired experience of your target audience.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

	User experience is how a user feels as they navigate your site.  You ultimately cannot control how people are going to feel when using your site.  But you can run alot of experiments to see if various designs attract more desired users and/or drive more desired behavior out of your site visitors.  UX designers are specifically tuned into this aspect of design.  The way that a user feels while on your site affects their relationship with your brand and product.  This is uderstandably very valuable to the success of your company/product/brand/site/etc.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

	The most tedious part of the challenge was answering questions 2-4 in this reflection.  They felt a bit frivolous and redundant.  We are being instructed to build a specific type of site (with a great purpose of teaching us process and basic HTML), so it seems silly to have to then come here and explain the site's purpose.
