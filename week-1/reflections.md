# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

The main concept I focused on was Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset.  This bootcamp will be challenging, and time management will be it's own skill in this context to improve upon - especially in these first 9 weeks where I (and many others) are still working and carrying out other time consuming elements of our daily lives.  I felt a little bummed this week because I didn't feel as though I was easily able to do DBC work during the times I thought I would be able to.  So the weekend arrived, and I basically still had the entire week's work to do.  Thoughts and stresses started flooding in about falling behind, failing, getting a bad score, missing an assignment, or receiving negative peer feedback.  This was me immediately exercising my well-versed Fixed Mindset.  As I revisited the readings on this topic, I turned to the Growth Mindset material heavily and worked to push all of those anxieties away and just sit down with the time I have now and do good work.  Forget about everything else, and today, I will start to get better at this.  And not just the coding parts, but also the time management parts.  So this first week exposed some time management struggles - great!  Better to attack time constraints now than later is how I will force myself to look at this.  

Time-boxing is the practice of working towards a specific goal for a pre-determined amount of time.  No matter where you are when this time is done, this method instructs you to stop your work and reflect on your progress and where you now stand, but bot to continue working on it just yet.  In Phase 0, this could be a handy technique to use to merge our studies into our daily schedules.  If you use very short increments of time, you won't threaten productivity in your daily life otherwise so highly.  Knowing that the time you are stepping away from your other obligations is very short allows you to step away entirely and focus on course work more easily.

During this first week, I planned to find breaks during work to accomplish much of my DBC work.  Not putting these breaks on a calendar ahead of time was a mistake, and I will be scheduling my breaks during the day moving forward.  I also found that I wasn't sleeping as well with this added responsibility tugging at my mind.  Not sleeping makes focusing at anything more difficult.  So I will be introducing a very strict wake up time to work out every morning.  I know that this will help me sleep and set a structured tone to each day.  Beyond that, I'm going to use extremely short 10 minute scheduled increments each hour to chip away at coursework.  This is completely achievable at my current job.  I will furthermore select two nights during each week to spend 2-3 hours solely on DBC work.  Weekends will soak up the rest.  Perhaps this doesn't exhibit extreme structure, but I think it is most important to add the small increments during each day, and iterate on the longer segments that will accompany these.

## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection



This was a great starting point.  Beyond being a sensible place to start us off, it felt approachable to a very new user.  I learned these foreign commands, but I was accomplishing tasks that I was extremely familiar with: creating new folders, navigating amongst folders, finding text in files, renaming files, deleting objects from folders, etc.  I also quick grabbed onto the "pwd" as a security blanket.  I loved seeing the little reassurance that I was only practicing this foreign concept  in my temp sandbox.  This empowered me to toy around with the commands beyond what was explicitly instructed.  For example, I liked seeing what happened when I left "-"s out whenever they showed up.  I figured it wouldn't do anything terrible in general, but it was reassuring to be in my temp folder family.  As I practiced, I can already visualize scenarios where using the terminal is way more efficient than navigating through folders traditionally.  Answers to other questions below.

What is a shell? What is "bash?"
The shell is what the user sees and where the user types commands and hits Enter to interact with the computer.
Bash is a very popular and widely used UNIX shell and command language that is used in a terminal environment.
What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
The most challenging thing was creating the txt file on my desktop and moving it over to my temp folder.  I figured it out, but I had to realize that I needed “cp” and not “mv”
Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
Yes.  This was fairly straightforward and will take practice and memorization to call on all of the encountered commands without referring to a list or very consciously sifting through memory of using/reading about each command.
In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
I think “pwd” to show you where you are. There is a certain amount of comfort I feel with typing this command and double checking where I am working.
The redirection commands allow you to start operating with more efficiency.  The compound the effectiveness of knowing individual commands.
Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
pwd: print working directory (“Where am I?”)

ls: list directory (“List the contents in this folder”)

mv: move/rename a file or directory to a new object

cd: change working directory. “cd” typed on it’s own takes you back to your home directory.

../: move up to the parent folder of your current directory

touch: create an empty file

mkdir: make a new directory/folder

less: shows one screen’s worth of the beginning of a text file. hit space bar to move page by page through the file.  hit q to exit the pager view.

rmdir: remove directory/folder

rm: remove file and maybe other objects

help: shows you a lot of text information about the following command (use “man” in mac)
