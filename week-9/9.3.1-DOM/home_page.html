<!-- Add your reflection here -->
<!-- # This challenge took me [#] hours. -->

<!-- 
Q: What did you learn about the DOM?
A: This is how you get away from having to manually write CSS and HTML out for everything!!!  Amazing.  I can now see that if you have to repeat structures or styles in your HTML/CSS files, you could just use JS and the DOM to write for loops and make that go so much faster.  Phew.

Q: What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM? 
A: We really only used the getElementById().change_specific_property_or_style over and over again.  So I'll need to ramp up on fancier methods as time goes on.
