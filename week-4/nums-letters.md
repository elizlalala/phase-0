##What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

*Float Division*
This is your standard numerical calculator division.  Both numerator and divisor should be of the float type (despite whether they are whole values or not) to produce a float quotient.  

*Integer Division*
Integer division will return another integer no matter what.  That integer is the quotient rounded down to the nearest whole number.  This type of division is useful in the context of dividing groups of objects where the objects themselves cannot be effectively partitioned.  if you have 5 quarters, and the washing machine costs 1 dollar's worth of quarters to operate, you can't do 1.25 loads of laundry.  You can only do 1 because it's 1 dollar or bust.
